# Crews vs Buzz: Coordination or a New Workspace?

Disclosure before anything else: I am building Crews, so this is not an independent review.
What I can do is be specific about what Buzz is, where it is genuinely stronger, and what
question actually separates the two — and let you decide from that rather than from a
feature table I control.

## The comparison that matters is not feature counts

Buzz and Crews both exist because several AI agents working near each other produce a
coordination problem that no single agent can see. Past that shared premise they take
different shapes, and the useful question is not which has more capabilities. It is:

**Are you willing to move where the work happens?**

Buzz asks you to adopt a workspace. Crews asks you to install an MCP server into the clients
you already run. Everything else follows from that, including the parts where Buzz is the
better answer.

## What Buzz is

Buzz is an Apache-2.0 open-source project from Block, built on the Nostr protocol and on
Block's Goose agent framework. It is a group workspace — channels, threads, direct messages,
voice, media — in which AI agents are first-class members rather than pasted-in output. You
invite Claude Code, Codex or Goose into a channel the way you would invite a colleague.

The part that deserves attention is identity. Agents in Buzz get their own cryptographic
identities and defined permissions, and activity is recorded as signed events. The
components reported include agent profiles and keys, channels, signed events, a relay,
search, an audit trail and ACP runtimes, with `buzz-acp` translating between the Agent
Client Protocol and MCP. Coverage also describes Git hosting and code-review workflows
inside it.

That is a real answer to a real problem. If you are running agents with meaningful
permissions and cannot say afterwards *which* agent did a thing and *whether it was allowed
to*, Buzz addresses that directly and Crews does not address it at all.

## What Buzz does not claim to be

One independent analysis is worth quoting because it is more careful than most launch
coverage: Buzz "did not make the hard parts of multi-agent orchestration disappear." The
same piece enumerates what is missing — no enforced task state, no lease or heartbeat
mechanism, no hard budgets, no reassignment of stalled work, no verification layer — and
concludes it should not be treated as a complete production orchestrator by default.

That analysis also does not describe repository conflict detection or file-edit coordination
among Buzz's features. Read that as what it is: an absence in the write-up, not a proof of
absence in the product. Check it against Buzz's own documentation before you rely on it
either way.

## What Crews is

Crews is an MCP server. Tower is the binary you install. It exposes shared file state across
the agents connected to one repository, warnings when one agent's work overlaps a file
another agent is already in, and direct messages between agent sessions.

The scope is narrow on purpose. Crews does not host code, does not run CI, does not merge,
does not do identity or audit, and does not replace review. It answers one question — *is
anyone else in this file right now* — early enough that the answer is still useful.

The delivery detail matters more than it sounds. Conflict warnings never ride on an optional
MCP capability. They arrive as banners on the result of whatever tool the agent just called,
and stay readable in `crews.message.inbox`. A warning that depended on server notifications
would silently disappear on the clients that do not implement them; riding on the tool result
means it reaches anything that can call a tool.

## Adoption cost, honestly counted

This is where the two genuinely diverge, and where I will try not to put a thumb on the
scale.

**Buzz costs a workflow change.** People and agents have to be in Buzz for Buzz to help. If
your team's conversation already lives in Slack and your code review already lives on GitHub,
adopting Buzz means either moving one of those or running a third place. That is not a
criticism — a shared room is the entire point, and a shared room only works if everyone is
in it. But it is a real cost and you should count it before the trial, not during.

**Crews costs a config entry.** It registers with the client each engineer already uses, and
the repository stays on GitHub with the history and permissions it already has. The
corresponding weakness is that Crews gives you nothing your existing tools do not already
give you *except* the coordination layer. There is no room, no audit trail, no identity model.

**Open source versus free tier is not the same thing, and the difference cuts against me.**
Buzz is Apache 2.0. You can read it, fork it, run it yourself, and keep running it if Block
loses interest. Crews has a free solo tier and $20 per seat per month for teams — currently
a preview, with paid billing not yet enabled — but "free to use" is a pricing decision I can
reverse, while "Apache 2.0" is a property of the software that I could not take away from you
if I wanted to. If that distinction matters to your team, weight it accordingly. It is one of
the strongest arguments for Buzz over Crews and it would be dishonest to bury it.

## How to actually evaluate this

Do not run a feature comparison. Run the same two-agent scenario through both and see which
failure you would rather have.

Pick a real dependency: one agent changes a shared type, another agent edits a caller. Give
each session its task without telling either about the other. Then watch for two things.

**First: does anything surface the coupling while the work is happening?** In Crews, the
overlap check is the mechanism, and the honest limit is that it only sees agents that are
participating — a manual edit or an unconnected tool is invisible to it, and you should test
that case deliberately rather than assume coverage. In Buzz, the mechanism is that both
agents are posting into a room a human can read, which catches a different and broader class
of problem, more slowly, and only if someone is reading.

**Second: afterwards, can you reconstruct who did what and whether they were allowed to?**
Buzz will answer that well. Crews will not answer it at all.

Those are different questions, and the one you care more about should decide this.

## When Buzz is the right call

Say so plainly: if you want agents and humans in one room with real identity, permissions and
a signed audit trail — and especially if open source is a requirement rather than a
preference — Buzz is built for that and Crews is not. It is also backed by Block, which is a
different order of resourcing than a small hosted product.

Crews is the right call in a narrower case: several people already working on one GitHub
repository, using different clients, who do not want to move anywhere, and whose actual
recurring pain is two agents editing the same file from different starting points.

If that is not your pain, the honest recommendation is the other tool.
