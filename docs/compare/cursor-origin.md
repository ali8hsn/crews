# Crews vs Cursor Origin

*Last checked 7 September 2026. Origin was not generally available at the time of writing.*

## What Cursor Origin is

Origin is Cursor's Git forge "for the agentic era" — a Git hosting platform built on the
premise that repositories will face many agents cloning, branching, committing and rebasing
in parallel, a different load profile from human-paced development. It was announced on
16 June 2026 at Cursor's Compile conference.

Reported features: Git compatibility with existing tooling, API and MCP extensibility,
agent-driven resolution of merge conflicts and CI failures, stacked pull requests (from
Cursor's acquisition of Graphite), merge queues, machine-readable review states, and a
hybrid NVMe/S3 storage architecture. The launch demo showed 22.6 commits per second in one
repository and hundreds of thousands of clones per hour.

**Availability:** waitlist only, with an expected autumn 2026 release. No pricing announced.

## Where they differ

These solve different halves of the problem and the comparison is not close.

Origin replaces **where your code lives**. It is a GitHub alternative, and adopting it means
migrating hosting. Its coordination happens at the *merge* boundary: stacked PRs, merge
queues, agents resolving conflicts after the fact, at very high throughput.

Crews leaves your code on GitHub and coordinates *before* the edit: which files each agent
currently has open, and a warning when one agent is about to work where another already is.
Crews does not host repositories, run merge queues, or resolve conflicts.

## The honest assessment

If Origin ships as described, teams already committed to Cursor's stack and willing to move
off GitHub get an integrated editor, cloud agents, review and hosting from one vendor. That
is a genuine advantage Crews does not offer and does not try to.

What Crews offers against it is that it works today, on the repository you already have, with
whatever mix of clients your team actually uses — Cursor included, alongside Claude Code,
Codex, VS Code, Kiro, Windsurf and Perplexity.

Because Origin is not generally available, everything above is drawn from the announcement
and reporting on it, not from use. It should be re-checked at release.
