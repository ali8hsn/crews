# Crews vs Entire

*Last checked 7 September 2026 against [entire.io](https://entire.io) and
[github.com/entireio/cli](https://github.com/entireio/cli).*

## What Entire is

Entire is Git hosting built for agents. Its homepage leads with "Git Hosting for Agents" and
a distributed, Git-compatible mirroring network for GitHub repositories, so agents can clone
without hitting origin rate limits. Alongside the hosting it stores code together with the
sessions, prompts and tool calls that produced it, offers agentic search across repositories,
commits and sessions, redacts secrets before storage, and mirrors into several regions.

The CLI is MIT-licensed and open source. It "hooks into your Git workflow to capture AI agent
sessions as you work. Sessions are indexed alongside commits, creating a searchable record of
how code was written." Its `enable --agent` flags cover Claude Code, Codex, Copilot CLI,
Cursor, Factory AI Droid, Gemini CLI, OpenCode and Pi. No price for the hosted platform was
published on the pages checked, so nothing is claimed about it here.

## The honest overlap

Both products accept that agents now write a large share of the code and that the record of
*how* a change happened matters. Both attach themselves to the repository you already have
rather than asking you to restructure work around a new object. Entire's session capture is
more thorough than anything Crews does: Crews records which files a session is working in,
not the prompts and tool calls that got it there.

## Where they differ

The two work at different moments. Entire is a **record**: it indexes what happened after a
session commits, and makes that history searchable. Crews is a **live channel**: it answers
what another agent has open right now, before you edit.

Entire's own documentation is explicit about the limit here. It acknowledges concurrent
sessions — "Multiple AI sessions can run on the same commit. If you start a second session
while another has uncommitted work, Entire warns you and tracks them separately" — and
separate tracking is the stated behaviour. No file locking, cross-agent conflict resolution
or agent-to-agent messaging is documented on the pages checked.

Crews is also narrower on infrastructure by choice. It does not host or mirror your code;
your repository stays on GitHub with the permissions and history it already has.

## Which to pick

- Slow clones at agent scale, regional hosting, or wanting to search why a line was written
  six weeks ago: Entire is built for that, and Crews does none of it.
- Two or more agents editing one repository at the same time, where the risk is that both
  open the same file: that is the case Crews is built for.

They compose cleanly. Entire records sessions; Crews coordinates them while they run.
