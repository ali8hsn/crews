# Crews vs MCP Agent Mail

*Last checked 7 September 2026 against [mcpagentmail.com](https://mcpagentmail.com/).*

Of everything on this page, MCP Agent Mail is the closest comparison to Crews. It solves the
same problem, at the same layer, over the same protocol.

## What MCP Agent Mail is

It describes itself as a "Git-auditable, SQLite-backed coordination fabric for multi-agent
coding: inboxes, reservations, threads, search, and operator tooling." Agents get a
project-scoped identity and a mailbox. Messaging is asynchronous and threaded, with subjects,
recipients, CC and BCC, importance levels and acknowledgement requirements.

File coordination works through advisory reservations: an agent declares intent to edit a set
of paths, expressed as glob patterns with TTL-based expiry, and overlapping reservations
surface as conflicts at the moment they are taken. An optional pre-commit Git hook can enforce
reservations rather than merely advising on them. It runs across Claude Code, Codex CLI and
Gemini CLI at once, installs with a shell script or `cargo install mcp_agent_mail_rust`, and
is MIT-licensed, free, with no cloud dependency or API key.

## The honest overlap

This is not a case of adjacent products that happen to share a keyword. Reservations map onto
Crews' claims, inboxes onto Crews' messaging, and both deliver conflict information before an
edit rather than at merge. If you have read the Crews documentation and then read theirs, you
will recognise most of the model.

MCP Agent Mail does two things Crews does not. Glob-pattern reservations with TTLs are more
expressive than per-path claims, and the optional pre-commit hook can *enforce* a reservation,
where a Crews claim is advisory unless a hard conflict denies it. It is also fully open source
and runs with no account, which matters if you cannot send repository metadata off the machine.

## Where they differ

Crews is a hosted service with a per-seat team tier; MCP Agent Mail is a local, self-hosted,
MIT-licensed binary backed by SQLite. That difference drives most of the rest. Crews maintains
state for a team across machines, so an agent on your laptop and an agent on a colleague's can
see one another; a SQLite file coordinates the agents that can reach it.

Client coverage differs too. Crews ships adapters for Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, VS Code,
Kiro, Windsurf and Perplexity, each writing that client's own config format, plus a generic
target. MCP Agent Mail names Claude Code, Codex CLI and Gemini CLI on the page checked.

Crews also carries a tool directory agents can search, which has no counterpart there.

## Which to pick

- One machine, or a team that wants no hosted dependency, and a preference for open source
  you can read and fork: MCP Agent Mail is a strong choice and is free.
- Agents spread across several people's machines and several different clients, where the
  coordination state has to outlive any one laptop: that is what Crews is for.

If you are choosing between them on the coordination model alone, they are close enough that
you should try both. Corrections to this page are welcome as an issue.
