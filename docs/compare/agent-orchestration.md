# Crews vs Agent Orchestration

## What Agent Orchestration is

An MIT-licensed MCP server for multiple AI agents working on the same codebase, aimed at race
conditions, stale reads and duplicate work. It provides shared memory for context and
decisions, a turn-based task queue with dependencies, resource locking to prevent concurrent
access to files, agent discovery so agents know who else is present, a research-first workflow
that requires context to be gathered before code is written, and status tracking.

It installs through `npx agent-orchestration init` and runs with `npx agent-orchestration
serve`. It works with any MCP-compatible tool, or any tool that reads `AGENTS.md`, and names
Cursor, Aider, Windsurf, VS Code Copilot, GitHub Copilot Coding Agent, Devin, OpenAI Codex and
Google Jules.

## The honest overlap

Resource locking and agent discovery cover the same ground as Crews' claims and session list.
Both are MCP servers, so both put coordination inside the agent's own tool list rather than in
a separate app you have to watch.

## Where they differ

Agent Orchestration is the more opinionated of the two. A task queue with dependencies and a
mandated research-first workflow prescribe *how* a team of agents should proceed; Crews takes
no position on sequencing and only reports who is in which file. If you want agents driven
through a defined pipeline, that is a feature there and an absence here.

The reverse also holds. Crews is built around one existing GitHub repository shared by a team
of people, with per-client adapters that write each client's native config, and coordination
state held for the team rather than per checkout. Agent Orchestration is a locally run npx
server; the repository does not document cross-machine team state or a hosted tier.

Crews adds agent-to-agent messaging with an inbox, and a searchable tool directory. Agent
Orchestration's shared memory covers some of the same need in a different shape: agents write
context others can read, rather than addressing a message to a specific session.

## Which to pick

- You want agents marshalled through an explicit task pipeline with a research gate, on one
  machine, for free: Agent Orchestration is built for that.
- You want several engineers' agents, in different clients, to stay out of each other's files
  in one shared repository: that is the Crews case.
