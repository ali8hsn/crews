# External action log

Newest first. Every action that reached outside this repository is recorded here with its
URL. Read-only fetches are logged as well as writes, so the list can be audited end to end.

**External writes so far: pushes to this repository's own `main`, and one commit to an
already-open pull request branch (see below).** No new PR has been opened, no form
submitted, no message posted, no email sent.

### Reads — research session (cloud, no GitHub credential, no writes outside this repo)

This session filed nothing. Every row is a read. It could not push, open a PR or submit a
form even had it been asked to.

### Session coordination — 2026-09-07 ~10:5x

| Action | Target | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Messaged the registry session (PR #1) with the Glama connectors task | session "Dockerfile and MCPB bundle for search listing" | delivered; that session is stopped, so it arrives on resume |
| Wrote `.crews/messages/external-writes-policy.md` for the research session | in-band coordination channel | committed |
| Cancelled cron `cce5e825`, scheduled `10d94269` (`3,23,43 * * * *`) | this session | the old prompt asked for drafting work the research session now owns |
| `git pull /Users/ali/crews-docs-research main` | research clone | already up to date, nothing to push |
| Verified PR #1 image references | https://github.com/ali8hsn/crews/pull/1 | 0 × `ghcr.io/ali8hsn`, 18 × `ghcr.io/bmp0404` — clean |

### Writes — external, by the research session (logged here after the fact)

| Time (UTC) | Action | URL | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 10:33 | Created a Google Doc mirroring this session's output files | https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UVaobgybBp9kerDfEwFYkzx7Gx9mAejEWM94Hsa8mVM/edit | created, owned by the UT account |

Logged by the `/loop` session because it was missing. This is a write to an external
service, and the research session's own commit `61ff1a2` states "No writes outside this
repo", which is not accurate — the mirror was created three minutes later in `e94bfcf` and
recorded only in `.crews/claims/research-session.md`, not here. The content is the repo's own
research notes going to the owner's own Drive, so the exposure is small, but the division of
labour says external actions belong to this session and this one was not asked for.

| Time (UTC) | Action | URL | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ~10:5x | `git push origin main` — five research-session commits (items 4, 5, item 3 recon, gate restore) | https://github.com/ali8hsn/crews/commits/main | pushed |

Nothing filed this fire: `docs/seo/submission-queue.md` has no entry marked `ready`.

### Writes — PR #1 update

| Time (UTC) | Action | URL | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ~10:3x | Pushed to branch `registry/docker-and-mcpb`, updating the open PR — root `Dockerfile`, `docs/run/ghcr.md`, deduped Glama/Smithery sections | https://github.com/ali8hsn/crews/pull/1 | pushed, **not merged** |

No image pushed to any registry. Nothing submitted to Glama or Smithery. MCPB bundle not
uploaded. `docs/seo/submission-queue.md` has nothing marked `ready`, so nothing was filed.
